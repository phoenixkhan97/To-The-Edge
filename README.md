# Project Title: To-The-Edge

To The Edge is a simple sidescroller game that utilizes HTML, CSS and Javascript as its main source of code. Using WAD arrowkeys, the user will be able to jump and land on platforms. The goal is to get to the end without falling into the pits. 

## Getting Started

1. Creating a set up and player
2. Adding gravity using velocity, height and width, and x and y axis
3. Create platforms and player physics
4. Illusion of background movement
5. Possible level creation and design if time permits
